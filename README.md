# Vision Statement
The goal of this app is to create an application allowing users to record things they find important from books, such as characters or locations, describe what they learned from a book, provide a synopsis of the book, and extract data from these things.

This application is for readers who want to get the most out of the books they read, 
providing an outlet to reflect on the chapters they have read, and the whole book in 
general. Their will be features allowing user to record places described in the book
and view them on an interactive map. If books mention other books, then these can be 
recorded and viewed using node maps.

This is unlike Goodreads as it is not about reviewing a book, its about experiencing 
other peoples knowledge gained from the book and what they found most important. This 
can help readers reflect on how they read and learn new ways to gain information from 
what they read.

# What I Am Accomplishing With This Project 
This project is a way for me to learn a new programming language (PHP), and hone the skills 
and knowledge I already have with SQL and apply it to a web based project. 

When I am reading books, I always take note of the locations mentioned, characters, and references to other books. 
I thought it would be cool to have an app where there were different sections to record these things separately, 
and maybe eventually extract data from these things. For the locations it would be nice to show on a map possibly using 
google API to show the locations mentioned in a book, or create a node connection chart for these things like Neo4j does.

This is also a chance for me to build a project using an Agile approach, where I first plan out what I want, plan out the features and make timelines and 
program the app in iterations, creating a release after each iteration. I will most likely perform a release after each major feature completed.

I also want to encorporate Test Driven Development, writing tests after small functions are created and making sure features are fully tested before moving to the next feature. This will help better document the code, provide reassurance there are no bugs in the code and make it easier to spot bugs.
