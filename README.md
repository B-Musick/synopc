# Vision Statement
SynopC is a means to get more experience using SQL queries within an application, 
learning to use Angular as well as SASS in order to expand my knowledge. It is also 
to create an application allowing users to describe what they learned from a book, 
provide a synopsis of it.

This application is for readers who want to get the most out of the books they read, 
providing an outlet to reflect on the chapters they have read, and the whole book in 
general. Their will be features allowing user to record places described in the book
and view them on an interactive map. If books mention other books, then these can be 
recorded.

This is unlike Goodreads as it is not about reviewing a book, its about experiencing 
other peoples knowledge gained from the book and what they found most important. This 
can help readers reflect on how they read and learn new ways to gain information from 
what they read.
